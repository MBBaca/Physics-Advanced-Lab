Completed two group projects by using Arduino and C language programming. First, we created a portable weather station that would gather and relay data on wind speed, humidity, temperature, and rain amount. Next, we automated a self-running vacuum system programmed to turn on and off specific pumps and safety features as internal pressure changed.
